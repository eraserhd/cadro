== Arbor


== Development

Start the nREPLs and build everything for debug.

----
$ npm install
$ npx shadow-cljs watch app
----

Connect to the CLJS REPL:

----
$ npx shadow-cljs cljs-repl app
----

Run tests:

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (refresh) (run-tests)
----

Testing on tablet:

----
$ npx shadow-cljs release app
$ npx cap run android
----

== Running droserve (fake DRO server)

=== Pairing the Tablet

----
$ bluetoothctl
> discoverable on 
----

In a separate terminal:

----
$ droserve
----

Attempt to pair the tablet in Settings | Bluetooth.

You might have to type "yes" to allow the connection in bluetoothctl.  Then in bluetoothctl:

----
> devices Paired
Device 78:D6:DC:C1:BA:22 Lenovo Tab M10 Plus 3rd Gen
> trust 78:D6:DC:C1:BA:22
----

This prevents needing to allow the connection every time.

From this point forward, just `droserve` should be necessary.
